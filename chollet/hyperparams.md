## questions
- what should be the size of validation set? for big datasets (for example 1M examples) 
we have to choose 1% as a validation set (so 10K examples); this is very different from 
usual practice to use 20-30%; (Ng-strategy-1-06);
- how should we create validation set? using `train_test_split` from sklearn;
